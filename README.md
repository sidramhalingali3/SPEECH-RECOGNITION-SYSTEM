*DESCRIPTION OF TASK*: The Speech Recognition System is an innovative embedded or software-based project that enables machines to recognize and respond to human voice commands. It uses tools like microphones for input, a microcontroller (e.g., Raspberry Pi or Arduino with external modules), or a computer with speech processing libraries such as Python's SpeechRecognition, Google Speech API, or CMU Sphinx. The system captures audio input, processes it through a feature extraction algorithm (like MFCC), and then classifies the speech using machine learning models or pre-trained APIs. Platforms such as Python, TensorFlow, or MATLAB may be used, depending on whether the project is hardware-based or purely software. This system is widely applicable in voice-controlled home automation, hands-free devices, assistive technologies for the disabled, smart appliances, and automotive voice commands. It enhances user interaction with machines by eliminating the need for physical interfaces. This project not only demonstrates the integration of digital signal processing and AI but also provides practical experience in real-time audio handling, data preprocessing, and system control, making it a powerful addition to any GitHub portfolio.
